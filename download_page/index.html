			<h2>Features</h2>
			<h3> What? </h3>
			<p>LumberJack is an IRC Logbot, paired with a web application for browsing and searching through logs.</p>
			<p>It is written in Python (for the logger), and PHP & JavaScript (for the client).</p>
			<p>A sample implementation is pointed at the channel #sfucsss, on irc.freenode.net.  View it <a href="http://curtis.lassam.net/pierc/">here</a>.</p>
			<h3> Why? </h3>
			<p>A lot of companies and projects use IRC chat for internal team communication.  
			It's a great way to connect a team semi-synchronously.  The only trouble is that an individual team member only has logs of the conversation for when he's around.
			Clever folks just leave their IRC client logged in all of the time, and log into <em>that</em> whenever necessary &mdash; but I'd argue that that's a bit of a pain.
			Sometimes, teams need a way to archive and search through IRC logs. </p> 
			<h3> Who? </h3>
			<p> I'm <a href="http://curtis.lassam.net">Curtis Lassam</a>. You're on my website. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="tabs-2">
			<h2>Download</h2>
			<p>You can download LumberJack here: </p>
			<p> &nbsp; <a href="lumberjack_1.0.zip">LumberJack_1.0.zip</a> </p>
		</div>
		<div id="tabs-3">
			<h2> Instructions </h2>
			<h3> Requirements </h3>
			<p> LumberJack requires that you have the following...</p>
			<ul> 
				<li>A web server, capable of running PHP5 applications, with MySQL installed.</li>
				<li>A computer with a stable connection to the internet, running Python, with Python-MySQL installed.  </li> 
			</ul>
			
			
			<h3> Step 1: Make Sure A Database Is There </h3>
			<p> On your webserver, create a MySQL database for use with LumberJack, and a user/password combination that can access the DB. </p>
			<pre>
$ mysql -u adminusername -p
Enter password:
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 5340 to server version: 3.23.54
 
Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.
 
mysql> CREATE DATABASE lumberjack;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
 
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON lumberjack.* TO "lumberjack_user"@"hostname"
	-> IDENTIFIED BY "lumberjack_password";
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
  
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

mysql> EXIT
Bye
$ 
			</pre>
			<p> If your webserver is not going to be the same computer as the one running the logger, the database will need to be configured to allow remote login. </p>
			
			
			<h3> Step 2: Start Logging </h3>
			<p> The <code>bot</code> folder in the download contains all of the code necessary to run the log bot. Unpack it into a directory. </p>
			<p> Install Python, and the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/">mysql-python</a> libraries. 
			Note that, on Ubuntu <small>(and other Debian based OSes)</small>, this requires a simple <code>apt-get install python-mysql</code>. </p>
			<p> To configure the bot, copy irc_config.txt.example to irc_config.txt, and mysql_config.txt.example to mysql_config.txt </p>
			<pre>
me@puter: ~/bot/$ cp irc_config.txt.example irc_config.txt
me@puter: ~/bot/$ cp mysql_config.txt.example mysql_config.txt
			</pre>
			<p> Set the variables in irc_config to correspond to the channel that you want to log. </p>
			<p> Set the variables in mysql_config to correspond to the database that you're logging to. </p>
			<p> To install the tables in the database, run the command: </p>
			<pre>
me@puter: ~/bot/$ python LumberJack_Database.py
			</pre>
			<p> To run the logger, run: </p>
			<pre>
me@puter: ~/bot/$ python LumberJack.py
			</pre>
			
			<p> Notably, if you're running LumberJack on a remote server, you might consider sending output to a file, disabling 'hangup', and nice-ing it. </p>
			<pre>
me@remote: ~/bot/$ nohup nice LumberJack.py &
			</pre>
			
			<h3> Step 3: Run the Client </h3>
			<p> The <code>web</code> folder in the download contains all of the code necessary to run the client. </p>
			<p> Plunk the directory's contents down in a Apache server, one that's running PHP and PHP-MySQL. </p>
			<p> To configure the client, copy config.php.example to config.php</p>
			<pre>
me@puter: ~/bot/$ cp config.php.example config.php
			</pre>
			<p> Then, set the database details and default channel to mirror the bot's settings. </p> 
			<p> You should be GOOD TO GO! Try navigating to the client from the web! </p>
			
			<h3> What if I have problems? </h3>
			<p> Well, as of right now, you can e-mail them to me (<em>curtis@lassam.net</em>), and I'll try to figure them out, or ridicule you.  </p>

			<h2>The Future</h2>
			<p> Here are some things to be addressed in future versions of LumberJack:  </p>
			<ul>
				<li> The Logger, Database, & JSON service all support logging of multiple channels, but the front-end provides no method to view anything but the default channel. </li>
				<li> Things work very strangely (and often not at all) in Google Chrome. </li>
				<li> With a MySQL database full of IRC data, stats gathering should be a breeze. </li>
				<li> The ability to store & sync IRC preferences across multiple clients. </li>
				<li> The ability to directly prompt the logbot to provide you, privately, with n lines of backscroll. </li>
				<li> The development of another Bot, for feed, SVN, and GIT integration. </li>
				<li> The ability to hide potentially embarassing or insecure chunks of information on request. </li> 
				<li> The ability to selectively ignore users from the client. (With this data saved in a cookie) </li>
				<li> Stability. More of it.  </li>
			</ul>
